# CPP-Neural-forward-realization
Just a very simple neural network forward realization
I find something in the class that learnt was very fun so that I am trying to realise it using cpp.
The weights that I set that is intent to solve a nonlinear problem. It is that in a 3 digits input if the numbers of 1 is 0 or 2 it output 0
for example like (1, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 0) ortherwise it output 1.
You can change input by simply change the Neural variables of the inputlayer.
